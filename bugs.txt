  - white border around checked non-selected property checkbox
  - displaying "true/false" instead of checkbox for readonly property
- tooltip window will be cut (overdrawn) by opengl viewport
  ? can disable continuous updating of viewport (when no animation running)
    to allow hints
  - use alternative hint display (statusbar, help panel etc)
