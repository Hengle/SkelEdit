- after editing something with gizmo, edited object in PropGrid should be updated (partially)

- wxTimer: exceptions not handled, simply ignored; side effect: exception (assert) in WPropEdit::OnTimer() ignored!

- bool property editor:
  - white border around checked non-selected property checkbox
  - displaying "true/false" instead of checkbox for readonly properties

- tooltip window will be cut (overdrawn) by opengl viewport
  - use alternative hint display (statusbar, help panel etc)

  * FIX:
    1) remove following lines from MyApp::OnInit():
	frame->SetToolTip("\n");
	frame->SetToolTip(NULL);
       (allows multiline tooltip)
    2) remove section from application.mainfest:
	<dependency>
	  <dependentAssembly>
	    <assemblyIdentity type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0'
	      processorArchitecture='x86' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*' />
	  </dependentAssembly>
	</dependency>
    Tech info:
      after this, tooltip becomes correct, and multiline text will be supported.
    BAD DLL:
      C:\WINDOWS\WinSxS\x86_Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls_6595b64144ccf1df_6.0.2600.2982_x-ww_ac3f9c03\COMCTL32.dll
    GOOD DLL:
      C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\COMCTL32.DLL
      (in this case, loaded both dlls!)

- "play" and "pause" buttons behaviour is almost identical

- TArray<> property editor:
  - TArray<float> has non-editable floats, because each array entry is marked with WDynArrayEntryEditor, which
    has no editor controls
    - should make generic ArrayEntryEditor, which will analyze CProperty and decide, which editor to use (no editor,
      string, combo box ...); best - find a way to attach to already connected editor to add new button(s)

- wxPropertyGrid bugs:
  - (1.3.1) wxFileProperty bug, overriden with WFileProperty::GetValueAsString() (bug/feature of wxFileName class?)
  - (1.3.1) crash when removing array entry and double click on next entry, which is moved up to a place of just
    removed item; crashed in double-click handler of m_propHover, which points to deleted item; fixed in
    WPropEdit::RemoveArrayEntry() by setting m_propHover to NULL
