- bool property editor:
  - white border around checked non-selected property checkbox
  - displaying "true/false" instead of checkbox for readonly property
- tooltip window will be cut (overdrawn) by opengl viewport
  ? can disable continuous updating of viewport (when no animation running)
    to allow hints
  - use alternative hint display (statusbar, help panel etc)
- "play" and "pause" buttons behaviour is almost identical
- when mesh is scaled, soft normals skinning is incorrect (normal length is
  not equals 1); needs additional scale; in-editor bug only; reproduce: set
  MeshScale for any mesh to low value
  ? possibly, OpenGL has flag to indicate "normals should be normalized"
