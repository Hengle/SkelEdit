umodel-relative:
- merge GlViewport <- GlWindow
- use SkelMeshInstance from umodel
- try to use SkeletalMesh from umodel, but warning: SkelEdit uses .uc to generate C++ code
- support anim.config and AnimRotationOnly features (should be supported with umodel's SkelMeshInstance)
- support mesh materials

- try to build monolithic wxWidgets DLL with VC10
- embed .manifest into the executable
